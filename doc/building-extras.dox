@brief Guide how to download and build extras for Magnum engine.

@tableofcontents

Extras are additional functionality for Magnum C++11/C++14 graphics engine --
playground for testing new APIs, specialized stuff that doesn't necessarily
need to be a part of main Magnum repository or mutually exclusive
functionality.

The source is available on GitHub: https://github.com/mosra/magnum-extras.
Building extras is very similar to building Magnum itself. See @ref building
for additonal information about building and running tests, crosscompiling and
platform-specific issues.

Similarly to Magnum, the libraries are build as shared by default. If you are
developing for platform which doesn't support shared libraries or if you just
want to link them statically, enable `BUILD_STATIC` to build the libraries as
static. If you plan to use them with shared libraries later, enable also
position-independent code with `BUILD_STATIC_PIC`.

Libraries built in `Debug` configuration (e.g. with `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` set
to `Debug`) have `-d` suffix, similarly to what is done when
@ref building "building Magnum itself".

By default no libraries are built and you need to select them manually:

-   *(none yet)*

Note that [each namespace](namespaces.html) contains more detailed information
about dependencies, availability on particular platform and also guide how to
enable given library in build and use it with CMake.

@section building-extras-arch Building ArchLinux packages

In `package/archlinux` directory is currently one package for Git development
build. The package is also in AUR under the same name.

There are also a few development PKGBUILDs in `package/archlinux`, which allow
you to build and install the package directly from source tree without
downloading anything. The native PKGBUILDs also contain `check()` function
which will run all unit tests before packaging.

@section building-extras-gentoo Gentoo ebuilds

Gentoo Git ebuild is available in `package/gentoo` directory.

@section building-extras-deb Building DEB packages

There is also `package/debian/` directory with all files needed for building
Debian packages. You need to have `corrade-dev` DEB packages installed and in
addition also `dpkg-dev` package. Building is easy, just change directory to
package root, copy `package/debian` directory there and run `dpkg-buildpackage`:

    cp -r package/debian .
    dpkg-buildpackage

This will compile binary and development packages, which will then appear in
parent directory. If you need to modify CMake flags (enabling/disabling some
libraries, for example), modify the last entry in `debian/rules`.

@section building-extras-ci Continuous Integration

@subsection building-extras-ci-travis Travis

In `package/ci/` there is `travis.yml` file with Linux GCC 4.7 and OSX Clang
configuration. Online at https://travis-ci.org/mosra/magnum-extras.

@subsection building-extras-ci-appveyor AppVeyor

In `package/ci/` there is `appveyor.yml` file with Windows MSVC configuration.
Online at https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mosra/magnum-extras.

@subsection building-extras-ci-jenkins Jenkins

In `package/ci/` there are `jenkins.xml` and `jenkins-gltests.xml` files
containing job configuration, one for build and non-GL tests and the other for
GL tests only. Setup your Jenkins server, enable the **Git** and **Text-finder**
plugin and download the CLI application from here (replace `localhost:8080`
with your server name):

    http://localhost:8080/cli

Then add new jobs or update existing ones (update path to the `*.jar` file,
replace `localhost:8080` with your server name, replace `update-job` with
`create-job` if the job doesn't exist yet).

    java -jar ~/jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080 update-job MagnumExtras < package/ci/jenkins.xml
    java -jar ~/jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080 update-job MagnumExtras-GLTests < package/ci/jenkins-gltests.xml

Build is done using **Ninja** build system and everything possible is enabled.
It expects that **GCC** >= 4.9, 4.8, 4.7 and **Clang** are installed and there
are **OpenGL**, **OpenGL ES 2.0** and **OpenGL ES 3.0** librares as it tries to
compile the library with every combination of them. You can add/remove the axes
in `axes/hudson.matrix.TextAxis` or via the web interface later.

MagnumExtras-GLTests depend on active X11 session, thus they should be run from
Jenkins instance running on graphical user session.

There is also MinGW-w64, Emscripten, NaCl and Android configuration, add or
update them with the commands below. See @ref building-crosscompiling for more
information about setting up the crosscompilers and `toolchains/` submodule.
For Emscripten you need also **Node.js** installed to run the tests.

    java -jar ~/jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080 update-job MagnumExtras-MinGW-w64 < package/ci/jenkins-mingw-w64.xml
    java -jar ~/jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080 update-job MagnumExtras-Emscripten < package/ci/jenkins-emscripten.xml
    java -jar ~/jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080 update-job MagnumExtras-NaCl < package/ci/jenkins-nacl.xml
    java -jar ~/jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080 update-job MagnumExtras-Android < package/ci/jenkins-android.xml
