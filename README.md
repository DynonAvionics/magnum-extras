Here you find extra functionality for Magnum C++11/C++14 graphics engine -- 
playground for testing new APIs, specialized stuff that don't necessarily need 
to be a part of main Magnum repository or mutually exclusive functionality. If 
you don't know what Magnum is, see https://github.com/mosra/magnum.
